Please fill in answers to the questions below:

1. What's your name?
Andris Zonies

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
hw02.physicalmod.com

3. What's the link to your repository on github with your code?
https://github.com/AndrisZo/webdev

4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?
None

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?
Pretty comfortable: I was part of a web dev project last semester so I'm relatively comfortable
with HTML and CSS because I have some previous experience with it.

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?
None

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?
Fairly comfortable, again from previous experience. I still need to get used to 
using functional organization across large code bases, but I feel comfortable enough 
that I can write code with occasional references to documentation.

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)
When I first checked, I had an issue with the image tag in hw01 
because my image tag didn't have alternative text, and it was formatted as
 <image src="" /> when it should have been formatted as <img src="" alt=""> .
I fixed that, and now they all pass.

9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I took probably longer than I needed to on the calculator trying to make it look
decent, but I learned a lot about CSS along the way so that's okay. Overall
I thought it was okay.
