  <p> First, let's take care of the boring stuff. </p>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Here's the html tutorial, </a>
    and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/"> here's the css tutorial.</a></p>
  <p>Now, much more importantly, let's talk about</p>
  <h1><span id="p">P</span><span id="e">e</span><span id="n1">n</span><span id="g">g</span><span id="u">u</span><span
      id="i">i</span><span id="n2">n</span><span id="s">s</span></h1>
  <p>You can learn more about these adorable birds at their wikipedia article <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin">here.</a></p>
  <p>Look at how cute they are!</p>

  <p>This little one's named Skipper, he let Wikipedia take a great picture of him. Here he's really trying to fly, but
    sadly penguins are flightless. It's okay, he's doing his best and it looks fun anyway.</p>
  <p>Fun fact about Skipper, he's also been learning the basics of math!<br>
    He recently learned the concept of exponentials, and he's created this table of powers of two.</p>
    
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>x</th>
      <th>2^x</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>64</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>128</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>256</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>While making a table like this would be simple rote work for many humans, it was quite the accomplishment for our
    friend Skipper. We should all be very proud.</p>
