5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had the most problem with the ssh process because I didn't understand how it worked and initially
generated my ssh keys on my local machine, then tried to ssh in with my virtual machine. I couldn't understand
why the connection was being refused, and spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to get it
to ask for my ssh key before eventually realizing that I would need to change the ssh key to one I had 
generated on my linux VM. Everything after that moved a bit smoother as I could follow the class notes fairly 
well, but it took a while for me to just process what I was doing and understand how everything was working, 
which is why I'm turning in a little late. I think the extra time was worth it however because I now feel like
I understand everything I've done fairly well.
